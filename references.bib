   abstract = {Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur in vivo. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bézier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.},

   abstract = {Muscles undergo cycles of length change and force development during locomotion, and these contribute to their work and power production to drive body motion. Muscle fibers are typically considered to be linear actuators whose stress depends on their length, velocity, and activation state, and whose properties can be scaled up to explain the function of whole muscles. However, experimental and modeling studies have shown that a muscle’s stress additionally depends on inactive and passive tissues within the muscle, the muscle’s size, and its previous contraction history. These effects have not been tested under common sets of contraction conditions, especially the cyclic contractions that are typical of locomotion. Here we evaluate the relative effects of size, history-dependent, activation and three-dimensional effects on the work and power produced during cyclic contractions of muscle models. Simulations of muscle contraction were optimized to generate high power outputs: this resulted in the muscle models being largely active during shortening, and inactive during lengthening. As such, the history-dependent effects were dominated by force depression during simulated active shortening rather than force enhancement during active stretch. Internal work must be done to deform the muscle tissue, and to accelerate the internal muscle mass, resulting in reduced power and work that can be done on an external load. The effect of the muscle mass affects the scaling of muscle properties, with the inertial costs of contraction being relatively greater at larger sizes and lower activation levels.},

	abstract = {Backed by a century of research and development, Hill-type muscle-tendon models are extensively used for countless applications. Lacking recent reviews, the field of Hill-type modelling is however dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on knowledge transmission, inter-study consistency, and innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of the field of Hill-type muscle-tendon modelling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and proposing updated terminology and definitions, and discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential improvements in modelling muscle properties. To achieve this aim, fifty-five criteria-abiding studies were extracted using a systematic search and their Hill-type models assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle-tendon properties, and a modelling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the model, and attention given to its modelling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance the dated gold standards in muscle modelling and do not build upon more recent advances, (2) overlook the importance of parameter identification and tuning, (3) are not strongly validated, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary material for understanding the literature, the results of this review open a discussion on the necessity for global recommendations in Hill-type modelling and more frequent reviews to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transmission and model reusability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
