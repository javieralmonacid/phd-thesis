%   PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.
%
%   The following packages are a few suggestions you might find useful.
%
%   (1) amsmath and amssymb are essential if you have math in your thesis;
%       they provide useful commands like ``blackboard bold'' symbols and
%       environments for aligning equations.
%   (2) amsthm includes allows you to easily change the style and numbering of
%       theorems. It also provides an environment for proofs.
%   (3) graphicx allows you to add images with \includegraphics{filename}.
%   (4) hyperref turns your citations and cross-references into clickable
%       links, and adds metadata to the compiled PDF.
%   (5) pdfpages lets you import pages of external PDFs using the command
%       \includepdf{filename}. You will need to do this if your research
%       requires an Ethics Statement.

%   OTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here. We've started you off with
%   a few suggestions.
%
%   (1) Use a single word space between sentences. If you disable this, you

%   (2) Correct the capitalization of "Chapter" and "Section" if you use the
%       \autoref macro from the `hyperref` package.
%   (3) The LaTeX thesis template defaults to one-and-a-half line spacing. If
%       your supervisor prefers double-spacing, you can redefine the

\section{Physiology of skeletal muscle}

\section{State of the art in muscle modelling}

\section{Continuum mechanics of deformable solids}

This might be a long section, maybe could be a chapter at the beginning of part 2? Should include some comments on generic deformation $\rho_0 \*u_{tt} = \Divt{\*P} + \*f$ and reduction to 1D if this is left as a section in the Introduction.

\part{One-dimensional elastodynamics}

\chapter{Inertial effects in multi-body mass-spring models of the muscle-tendon unit}

Work with Evan on mass enhanced muscle models. We need to discuss what would be appropriate to show here, besides the model and the numerical strategy (dynamic/mass effects? Focus on one cycle? Effects of different muscles and activities?).
Github repository: mass-enhanced-muscle-models.

Things that are not in Evan's thesis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item tendon dynamics
    \item what happens as the number of masses increases (homogenization study)
\end{enumerate}

Understanding the elastodynamics of skeletal muscle requires us to have an idea on the expected behaviour of muscle models. As a first approach to this task, we consider one-dimensional actuators. These are models that are well-established in the literature and that are part of major biomechanics software, such as OpenSim and FEBio [REFS]. Despite their apparent simplicity, however, these models are typically made of one or more highly-nonlinear ODEs whose stiff character cannot be overlooked.

\section{Mathematical description}

Consider the dynamic contraction of a muscle-tendon unit of length $L = L(t)$. Moreover, let $L_M$ and $L_T$ denote the muscle and tendon lengths, respectively, which satisfy $L_M(t) + L_T(t) = L(t)$ at every time $t \geq 0$.

We first define the \textit{muscle stretch} $\lambda_M$, the \textit{muscle strain} $\varepsilon_M$, and the {strain rate} $\depsilon_M$ as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_M := \dfrac{L_M}{l_{mus}^{opt}}, \qquad \varepsilon_M := \lambda_M - 1, \qquad \depsilon_M = \dfrac{1}{\depsilon_0} \dder{\lambda_M}{t} = \dfrac{1}{l_{mus}^{opt} \, \depsilon_0} \dder{L_M}{t},
\end{equation}
where $l_{mus}^{opt}$ is the optimal muscle length and $\depsilon_0$ is the maximum unloaded shortening strain rate. Similarly, we define the \textit{tendon stretch} $\lambda_T$ and \textit{tendon strain} $\varepsilon_T$ as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_T := \dfrac{L_T}{l^{opt}_{ten}}, \qquad \varepsilon_T := \lambda_T - 1,
\end{equation} 
with $l_{ten}^{opt} = L(0) - l_{mus}^{opt}$ being the optimal tendon length. The optimal muscle and tendon length corresponds to the length of the muscle and tendon parts of the MTU, respectively, at which the (relaxed) muscle is in static equilibrium.  These values can be initially calculated from literature, however, because we will be dealing with experimental data, some calibration is needed to ensure simulations begin from dynamic equilibrium (see Appendix \ref{app:calibration_optimal_initial_values}).

In a simple model, such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:muscle_models_1D}A, muscle can be thought as a one-dimensional spring containing a contractile element (CE) and a parallel elastic element (PEE). The first one is related to the force produced by actin-myosin interactions during activation, whereas the latter is related to passive components of the muscle fibre (such as titin), which act to prevent overstretching of the sarcomeres that form the muscle fibre. The muscle force $F_M$ in this case is given by Hill's equation,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Hill_force}
    F_{Hill}(\lambda, \depsilon) = F_0 \Big\{ a(t) F_A(\lambda) F_V(\depsilon) + F_P(\lambda) \Big\}.
\end{equation}
Several components can be identified in this equation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $F_0$ is the maximum isometric force that the muscle in study can exert on the tendon,
    \item $a = a(t)$ is an activation function characterizing the influx of $\mathrm{Ca}_2^+$ ions that trigger the formation of cross-bridges between actins and myosins within sacomeres. This function can be computed given an excitation $u(t)$ using Zajac's equation \cite{Zajac1989}:
    \begin{equation}
        \dfrac{da}{dt} + \dfrac{a(t)}{\tau_{act}} \left( \beta + (1-\beta)u(t) \right) = \dfrac{u(t)}{\tau_{act}},
    \end{equation}
    \item $F_A = F_A(\lambda)$ is the active force-length relationship, 
    \item $F_V = F_V(\depsilon)$ is the force-velocity relationship, 
    \item $F_P = F_P(\lambda)$ is the passive force-length relationship.
\end{enumerate} 
The force relationships $F_A$, $F_V$, and $F_P$ are typically fit from experimental data obtained through tensile experiments, and therefore do not have a standard expression. For this particular set of experiments, we use least-squares fits of the B\'{e}zier curves used by Ross et. al [CITATION]. The exact definition of these curves is available in Appendix B. Moreover, the muscle force $F_M$ is balanced by the tendon force $F_T$ at all times, that is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:massless_model}
    F_M(\lambda_M, \depsilon_M) = F_T(\lambda_T), \quad t > 0.

Equation \eqref{eq:massless_model} (which we refer to as the \textit{massless} model) represents a model of the MTU in which the mass of the muscle is not taken into consideration. While this may seem like an outrageous simplification of the problem, this is actually considered the ``gold-standard'' in muscle modelling. Hence, \textbf{this model's absence of mass (and therefore inertial forces) raises the question of whether including mass has any effect in the prediction of the dynamics (including forces) of the system}. In an attempt to answer this, Chen \cite{EvanThesis} has put forward a muscle model in which the mass of the muscle is equally distributed into $N$ segments (see Figure \ref{fig:muscle_models_1D}B). The dynamics in this model (which we refer to as the \textit{mass-enhanced} model) are given by the set of second-order ODEs:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:massenhanced_model}
    \begin{align}
        m_1 \ddot{u}_1 &= F_2(\lambda_2, \depsilon_2) - F_1(\lambda_1, \depsilon_1), \\
        m_2 \ddot{u}_2 &= F_3(\lambda_3, \depsilon_3) - F_2(\lambda_2, \depsilon_2), \\
        &\hspace{0.6em} \vdots \notag \\
        m_N \ddot{u}_N &= F_T(\lambda_T) - F_N(\lambda_N, \depsilon_N).
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here, $u_i$ is the displacement of the $i$-th segment, that is,
\begin{equation}
    x_i = u_i + x_i^0, \quad i=1,\dots,N,
\end{equation}
where $x_i^0$ is the initial position of the $i$-th segment. The segment stretches and strain rates, i.e.
\[
\lambda_i = \dfrac{l_i}{l_s^{opt}} = \dfrac{l_i}{l_{mus}^{opt}/N}, \quad \depsilon_i = \dfrac{\dot{\lambda_i}}{\depsilon_0}, \quad i = 1,\dots,N,
\]
can be written in terms of the displacements $u_i$ as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_1 = \dfrac{u_1 + l_s^0}{l_s^{opt}}, \quad \lambda_2 = \dfrac{u_2-u_1 + l_s^0}{l_s^{opt}}, \quad \dots \quad, \lambda_N = \dfrac{u_N-u_{N-1} + l_s^0}{l_s^{opt}},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \depsilon_1 = \dfrac{\dot{u}_1}{l_s^{opt} \depsilon_0}, \quad \depsilon_2 = \dfrac{\dot{u}_2-\dot{u}_1}{l_s^{opt} \depsilon_0}, \quad \dots \quad, \depsilon_N = \dfrac{\dot{u}_N - \dot{x}_{N-1}}{l_s^{opt} \depsilon_0},
\end{equation}
with $l_s^0 := L_M(0)/N$ is the initial length of each segment.



\section{Biomechanical data and initial conditions}

To compare the performance of the muscle models \eqref{eq:massless_model} and \eqref{eq:massenhanced_model}, we use the motion-capture and electromyography (EMG) data collected in \cite{EvanThesis}. The data corresponds to the human muscle-tendon unit dynamics of three muscles (medial gastrocnemius (MG), vastus medialis (VM), and semitendinosus (ST)) during three tasks (walking, cycling, and running). In particular, we are given to as a set of traces of muscle excitation $\widehat{u}$ and MTU length $L$ over the span of 24.99 seconds.

TO DO HERE

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain subject data (mass, height, tasks).
    \item Explain how muscle volume is computed.
    \item initial conditions (either refer to Appendix A or bring those contents here).
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Calibration of optimal and initial muscle parameters in the context of experimental data}
\label{app:calibration_optimal_initial_values}

This is from Evan's thesis and the report TR2023-04. Needs to be updated to the appropriate notation.

To minimize overshooting at the beginning of the simulation due to potential imbalance of forces, we must first calibrate our model. The idea is that a system that starts at rest should remain at rest if the initial length of the elements corresponds to their optimal length (in this case, $\widehat{\lambda}_i = 1$). Moreover, the sum of forces should also be zero at the beginning of the simulation. This affects the optimal and initial lengths, respectively, of the muscle belly and tendon.


Let $r$ denote the \textit{estimated} ratio between the length of the muscle belly and the length of the MTU. Then, we can \textit{estimate} the optimal muscle belly and tendon length as follows:
\[
	\widetilde{l_{mus}^{opt}} := l_{MTU}^{opt} r, \qquad \widetilde{l_{ten}^{opt}} := l_{MTU}^{opt}(1-r).
\]
First, in a situation where the MTU is resting at optimal length, the muscle and tendon forces should balance: $F_M(1) = F_T(1)$. However, because there might be discrepancy between the normalization factors used to construct the force-length relationships and the ones used in this work, we assume that the true optimal lengths are small deviations of the estimated ones:
\[
	l_{mus}^{opt} = \widetilde{l_{mus}^{opt}} + \Delta l^{opt}, \qquad l_{ten}^{opt} = \widetilde{l_{ten}^{opt}} - \Delta l^{opt}.
\]
The correction $\Delta l^{opt}$ can then be found by solving the equation
\begin{equation}
	F_P\left( \dfrac{\widetilde{l_{mus}^{opt}}}{\widetilde{l_{mus}^{opt}} + \Delta l^{opt}} \right) = F_T \left( \dfrac{\widetilde{l_{ten}^{opt}}}{\widetilde{l_{ten}^{opt}} - \Delta l^{opt}} \right).	
\end{equation}


Similarly, we can estimate the initial muscle belly and tendon lengths:
\[
	\widetilde{l_{mus}^0} := L(0)r, \qquad \widetilde{l_{ten}^0} := L(0)(1-r).
\]
Therefore, the \textit{true} initial muscle belly and tendon lengths is given by
\[
	l_{mus}^0 = \widetilde{l_{mus}^0} - \Delta l^0, \qquad l_{ten}^0 = \widetilde{l_{ten}^0} + \Delta l^0.
\]
The correction in this case is found by solving:
\begin{equation}
	F_M \left( \dfrac{\widetilde{l_{mus}^0} - \Delta l^0}{l_{mus}^{opt}}\right) = F_T \left( \dfrac{\widetilde{l_{ten}^0} + \Delta l^0}{l_{ten}^{opt}}\right).
\end{equation}
